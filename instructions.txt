Milestone one requirements
    - 5 primitives: integer, float, boolean, string, cell address
    - 7 arithmetic ops: add, subtract, mult, divide, modulo, exponent, negation
    - 3 logical operations: and, or, not 
    - cell lvalues: a pair of column and row expressions that yields an address primitive when evaluated.
    - cell rvalues: a pair of column and row expressions that yields the value at its address when evaluated.
    - 6 bitwise: and, or, xor, not , left shift, right shift
    - 6 relational: equals, not equals, less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal
    - 2 cast operations: float to int, int to float
    - 4 stat func: max, min, mean, and sum

Each abstraction should have: 
    - a constructor receiving child nodes or other necessary state as parameters
    - accessors for state, as needed
    - a visit method, as described below
    - no serialization or evaluation in these classes 



Notes:

should probably have an expression class that all models implement?
need to implement cell_vals.rb and stat_funcs.rb
test in main that we can add several expressions and serialize and evaluate them 

What is the difference between cell left values and right cell values?
Primitives in serializer can problably be done in a single method - Jerry.
